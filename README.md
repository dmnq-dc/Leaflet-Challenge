# Leaflet-Challenge
Week 15 Module Challenge

### Background <br>

The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, you have been tasked with developing a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

### :world_map: Leaflet Map Challenge - Part One (Earthquake Visualisation)

1. Get your dataset USGS GeoJSON Feed :  https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php
2. Specify the API endpoint (All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days): https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson
3. Import and visualise the data: <br>
  3.1 Using Leaflet, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude.<br>
  3.2 Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by colour. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in colour. <br>
  (Hint: The depth of the earth can be found as the third coordinate for each earthquake.) <br>
  3.3 Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked. <br>
  3.4 Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.<br>
